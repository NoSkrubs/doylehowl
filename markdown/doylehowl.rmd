# Introduction 

## Gallon-guzzling technique

It was Dec 6th, 2012 at exactly twenty-seven minutes past midnight that the first howl was heard. Fourteen days before the end of the world, a precursor to what would become confessional apocalypse began. Somewhere, someone, had collected a brief anonymous testimony and posted it on the popular blogging site tumblr.com. The text of this first spark of what would be a raging emotional inferno was simply,

> I know you are leaving Reed forever, but you will never leave my heart. DAT GALLON-GUZZLING TECHNIQUE

A forlorn exaltation into the cyber-sphere, a weary lover lamenting the invetible departure of their sexual compatriot; and - to add emphasis, a praise of fallacious talent. 

> DAT GALLON-GUZZLING TECHNIQUE

The first of thousands confessions to follow, all produced anonymously, all managed by a shadowy few secret keepers who would come and go over the proceeding months. In total three incarnations of the service would be wrought over a course of aproximately 18 months, from winter 2012 through the early autumn 2014. 11,485 posts would be made across the three Tumblr pages, which to this day still rest as a memorial to the emotional milue of a point in time; and for many, a continuing source of Google-able nostalgia, and embarassment.

With this memorial though, we can over the distance of time look back at those thoughts, those memories, those incarnations, and begin to understand through the lens of data and analysis what themes, trends, and cultural shifts occured over those 18 months. Although what comes to follow is by no means exhaustive, it is a first pass at what may be a rich source of information at a raw point in time in the lives of students at the Reed College, in Portland, OR.

## The right to forget

For the sake of privacy, all names have been removed from the quoted posts. Furthermore, the raw data of this analysis, and the location of the pages, is intentionally removed from this analysis and Github page. As we will all begin to see, some things we forget should remain forgotten
